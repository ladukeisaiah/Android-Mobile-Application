# VacayBud: Your Ultimate Vacation Planner
## Welcome
Welcome to the VacayBud project, an Android Mobile Application designed as my capstone project for my degree in Software Engineering at Western Governors University. VacayBud embodies the culmination of my learning journey, showcasing my ability to craft a comprehensive, user-friendly app dedicated to enhancing the vacation planning experience.

## Project Overview
VacayBud is created with the purpose of providing users with a seamless way to track their vacations, excursions, and associated costs. With functionalities allowing for the sharing of trip details with friends and the setting of calendar alarms and notifications, VacayBud stands as a testament to my proficiency in developing secure, database-backed mobile applications in an object-oriented language.

## Core Technologies

This application leverages:

- Java: For robust back-end functionality.
- Kotlin: Enhancing app development with concise and expressive code.
- SQLite: For secure, local database management.
- Room Interface: Simplifying database access and data management.
- Gradle: For dependable build management.
- Bootstrap CSS: Styling the app for a polished user interface.

## Development Process
This project allowed me to apply skills learned throughout my course, including UI design, database management, and application infrastructure development. Embracing challenges such as implementing responsive design and integrating multiple technologies, I have documented my development process, articulating solutions to application requirements and overcoming obstacles encountered along the way.

## Deployment and Availability
VacayBud is deployed on the Google Play Store and currently undergoing closed testing, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience upon official release.

## Future Directions
I plan to continue enhancing VacayBud, incorporating user feedback and exploring advanced features to make vacation planning even more enjoyable and comprehensive.

## Connect and Contribute
I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions to the VacayBud project. Together, we can make VacayBud the go-to app for travelers seeking a hassle-free way to plan and share their vacation experiences.

Thank you for exploring VacayBud. Your support and interest are invaluable as I continue to grow as a software engineer and develop solutions that make a difference.
